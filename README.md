# SniffSnake
**The malicous website detecting packet sniffer**
SniffSnake is a Python script that deconstructs Ethernet frames to detect whether a malicous or unproductive website is being used.
At this time the code only detects if the user is on facebook.com.
This code was written as part of my undergraduate disserataion. 
Imporvments may be made if I decide to continue with this for my Masters project.
